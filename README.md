# CategoricalCVABiplots

This zip file contains the code necessary to run a ShinyApp in R to compare various categorical biplot construction techniques. There are five data sets that are implemented with CVA (with label encoding), catPCA and CVA H biplots.

This Shiny app can be found online at:

Alternatively it can be run locally by running the following code in R:

library(shiny)
runGitHub("CategoricalCVABiplots","DavidRodwell")
